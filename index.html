		<p class=intro> The mecha world spans large and wide, 
		so much so that it can be intimidating for prospecting future pilots to know where to look.
		For them I say, Have no fear for Mech Year is around the corner!
		The goal of the year is to just enjoy the simple pleasures of giant robots who may or may not blow things up.
		Of course, not all mechs are created equally, have no fear if some things listed arent up your alley!</p>
